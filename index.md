## About Me

Welcome! I'm Chris Flores, a PhD Candidate in political science at Stanford University. My research broadly examines political behavior and race, ethnicity, and identity in the U.S.

My dissertation focuses on the racial identities of Latinos, who make up one in five individuals in the U.S. and complicate prevailing understandings of race and ethnicity. Using surveys, interviews, and administrative data, I explore the multiple ways Latinos identify their race in the U.S., how and why these racial identities are linked to political attitudes, and how they are socially constructed. In other projects, I examine Latino partisanship, restrictive immigration attitudes, and how political campaigns talk about immigration and Latinos. 

At Stanford, I am a fellow with the Center for American Democracy, and I am a 2023 recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Outside political science, I teach with the Stanford Jail and Prison Education Project at several jails in the Bay Area. Prior to Stanford, I received my A.B. in Politics and Latino Studies, summa cum laude, from Princeton University in 2021. Born and raised in Miami to Cuban parents, I am a proud graduate of Miami-Dade County Public Schools. Feel free to reach me at floresc@stanford.edu!

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
